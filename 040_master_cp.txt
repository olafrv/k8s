Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

 kubeadm join mlb:6443 --token px81nk.74fp7v6mz4coc1aj \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:be2e8048a50cd1d452abe4c1b56cca9e83f37452994ee45ba9ec2b98b4d97415 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key 5d433a90411c370cf75c162eca3b260fe0d467ee193ae740da6e391fdb7a9217

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join mlb:6443 --token px81nk.74fp7v6mz4coc1aj \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:be2e8048a50cd1d452abe4c1b56cca9e83f37452994ee45ba9ec2b98b4d97415
